- **üîß Built-in tools**: File operations, shell commands, web fetching, and more.
- **üîå Extensible**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for custom integrations.
- **‚ö° Includes Salesforce DX MCP Server**: Comes bundled with powerful tools for Salesforce development, including Aura-to-LWC migration, LWC component generation, code analysis, and mobile development utilities.

## üîê Authentication

Vibe Codey CLI uses your Salesforce Developer Edition org credentials to connect to the Salesforce LLM Gateway.

You can provide your org's username or alias in two ways:

### Option 1: Command-line flag (Recommended)

Pass the `--gateway-org` flag when you run `codey`:

```bash
codey --gateway-org your_username_or_alias
```

### Option 2: Environment variable

Set the `CODEY_GATEWAY_ORG` environment variable in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`):

```bash
export CODEY_GATEWAY_ORG="your_username_or_alias"
```

Then you can run `codey` from any directory:

```bash
codey
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Basic Usage

#### Start in current directory

```bash
codey --gateway-org your_username_or_alias
```

#### Include multiple directories

```bash
codey --gateway-org your_username_or_alias --include-directories ../lib,../docs
```

#### Non-interactive mode for scripts

Get a simple text response:

```bash
codey -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase" --gateway-org your_username_or_alias
```

For more advanced scripting, including how to parse JSON and handle errors, use the `--output-format json` flag to get structured output:

```bash
codey -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase" --output-format json --gateway-org your_username_or_alias
```

### Quick Examples

#### Start a new project

```bash
cd new-project/
codey --gateway-org your_username_or_alias > Write me an LWC component that displays a list of accounts.
```

#### Analyze existing code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salesforcecli/codey
cd codey
codey --gateway-org your_username_or_alias > Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```

## Included Tools: Salesforce DX MCP Server

Vibe Codey CLI comes bundled with the Salesforce DX MCP Server, providing a powerful suite of tools tailored for Salesforce development right out of the box. These tools can help you with a variety of tasks, from modernizing old codebases to building new components with best practices.

- **Metadata**: Tools for performing metadata operations, including deploying and retrieving metadata.
- **Data**: Tools for performing data operations, including querying and updating data.
- **Aura Experts**: Tools for migrating Aura components to Lightning Web Components (LWC), including creating and enhancing migration blueprints.
- **LWC Experts**: A comprehensive set of tools for LWC development. Create components, generate Jest tests, get guidance on best practices, accessibility, and security.
- **Code-Analyzer**: Perform static analysis on your code to check for best practices, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
- **Mobile Toolsets**: Utilities for building mobile Lightning Web Components, with support for features like barcode scanning, biometrics, and NFC.

To see all available tools, you can run:

`> /mcp list`
